# ✈️ SkyResolve AI – Smart Conflict Detection & Resolution for ATC

SkyResolve AI is a smart Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation system built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and PyScript. It visualizes live flight data, detects conflicts between aircraft in real-time, and suggests automatic resolution strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔴 Live flight visualization using Leaflet.js and OpenSky API
- ⚠️ Conflict detection & resolution suggestions
- 📊 Charts dashboard with traffic insights (Chart.js)
- 🧠 OS Concepts integrated: MapReduce, threading, synchronization
- 🎨 Responsive, dark/light themed UI with Tailwind CSS
- 🔍 Flight search & filter functionality
